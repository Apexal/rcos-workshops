                        is, of course, because it is the greatest organization on campus.

                    <p>
                        School clubs/organizations have a high turnover rate as students
                        graduate right as they're finally getting experienced with their
                        positions.
                    </p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        This is unlike a workplace where you can come in, get trained by
                        experienced members, have the torch passed off to you, and
                        eventually do the same thing for new members down the line.

                    <p>RPI is exhausting.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        This has an effect on everything we try to do with RCOS. RCOS is
                        usually one of many courses eating up our time and energy.

                    <p>
                        RCOS ended up with disorganized, unstandardized data spread across
                        Google Drive, multiple different versions of Observatories, and
                        Submitty over the years.

                        Despite our best efforts, we get through the semester by the skin
                        of our teeth sometimes and don't usually have much time to sit
                        down and spend time and resources tweaking things to work better.

                        RCOS leadership ends up spending each semester wrangling with the
                        spread out information instead of being able to actively help out
                        members and mentors.
