                    <p>
                        School clubs/organizations have a high turnover rate as students
                        graduate right as they're finally getting experienced with their
                        positions.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This is unlike a workplace where you can come in, get trained by
                        experienced members, have the torch passed off to you, and
                        eventually do the same thing for new members down the line.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This has an effect on everything we try to do with RCOS. RCOS is
                        usually one of many courses eating up our time and energy.

                    <p>
                        RCOS ended up with disorganized, unstandardized data spread across
                        Google Drive, multiple different versions of Observatories, and
                        Submitty over the years.

                        There's no reason we should be asking you for your name and project name in your status updates,
                        or direct links to your contributions. If we had our data organized we'd be able to pull all of
                        that information
                        automatically whenver we need it.

                        spread out information instead of being able to actively help out
                        members and mentors.

                    <h2>Enrollments</h2>
                    <p>The <code>enrollments</code> table stores enrollments for each semester. This is probably the
                        most important table.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So much of RCOS data changes with each semester. It is vital that we can query our data for
                        specific semesters. The enrollments table lets us do this!
                        This is where we store what users are on what project, how many credits students are taking RCOS
                        for, who is a project lead for their project, and overall grading.

                        Think about how much of an improvement this is on past systems. Now instantly we can ask
                        questions like "Who was enrolled in RCOS last semester for credit on the OpenCircuits project?"
                        or
                        "Who was the project lead of YACS in Spring 2021?" These questions previously either couldn't be
                        answered at all or would have taken a lot of manual effort to figure out.

                        Many other tables in the database depend upon enrollments. It is definitely my favorite table :)

                    <h2>Meetings</h2>
                    <p>The <code>meetings</code> table stores all meetings each semester with different types and
                        properties that define how they are displayed on frontends.</p>
                    <img class="r-stretch" src="images/meetings_table.png" alt="Meetings table">

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The meetings table is what powers the RCOS Calendar in the Handbook. As you can see, meetings
                        are related to semesters and also possibly users if a specific user is hosting the meeting.
                        Meetings can be remote or in person, have agendas defined, and either be public or hidden! What
                        you see on the Calendar is a subset of meetings where <code>is_public = true</code>.

                        This is how we plan on making automated meeting reminders. We simply need a script that runs
                        periodically, checks if there are any meetings in the next 10 minutes, and sends a Discord
                        webhook announcing them.
                        The hard part is hosting it properly somewhere stable.

                        If you look closely you might see the <code>presentation_markdown</code> column/field. In the
                        future, RCOS slides can be automatically generated based on the meeting type, agenda, and
                        markdown content all stored in the database record.

                    <h2>Chat Associations</h2>
                    <p>The <code>chat_associations</code> table powers the RCOS Discord server. It lets us connect a
                        project to a text channel, for example.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This tiny table is super powerful. This stores associations between chat
                        entities like Discord roles, text channels, voice channels, categories, etc. with RCOS entities
                        like projects and small groups.

                        This is how all of the roles assigned to you are in this database. To find the role for QuACS,
                        we simply query this table for the role ID.
                        We can even change the names of roles or channels with no trouble since their unique, immutable
                        ID is stored in the database.

                        The RCOS database must be future proof. As a result, it supports a variety of useful things that
                        we currently aren't using yet. One day, the database will store meeting attendance without
                        Submitty, status updates, all grading and comments, and so much more.
                        Hopefully in the year 3021 we'll be so organized that all RCOS members have to do is commit and
                        push.

                        Future versions of Observatory will no longer have their own separate database. All RCOS
                        infrastructure will read and write from the RCOS database.

                        This was the real motivating goal behind the database. Telescope, the CAS portal, the Discord
                        bot, all become dummy clients on top of the database. This makes them easy to develop and
                        maintain, and lets us recover easily if they need to be scraped and rewritten.
